# the-node-operators-manual
A complete guide to building and operating secure bitcoin nodes and services.

This is the repository where I will upload my guide when it is completed. This is intended to be a free and open guide as a public service to help people to build and operate their own nodes and bitcoin servers. It will cover everything from hardware, software, security, compiling.
